# UML & Merise Diagrams

Merise is a method for guiding the analysis, design and development phases of a company's information system. It is a structured approach to the analysis, design and management of information systems, with a particular focus on data modeling and organization.

UML is a standardized modeling language used in software engineering to visually represent and document the various aspects of software systems. It provides a set of symbols and diagrams that help professionals such as software engineers, designers and analysts to visualize, design, communicate and document.

This application presents these diagrams along with essential information that will be helpful for studying.
